# clustering
Implement and provide the pseudo code, assumptions made, mean accuracy results and your
observations in a report format along with the code for the following clustering methods on any two
dataset from the list of 48 UCI ML repository datasets. You can randomly sample a subset of data
points/instances of relatively smaller size (order of 1000) for experimentation, in case when the the size
of original dataset is huge in terms of number of data points.
a) Agglomerative Clustering with two cluster merging criterions.
b) Spectral Clustering.
c) Kernel Kmeans Clustering with RBF and polynomial Kernels.
